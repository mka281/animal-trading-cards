			<p>Red panda is a close relative of giant panda. Although less popular, red panda is discovered 48 years before giant panda. This bear-like creature can be found in the Nepal, India, Bhutan, China, Laos and Myanmar. Intense deforestation resulted in great reduction in the number of red pandas in the wild. Other than habitat loss, number of red pandas is decreased through uncontrolled hunt because of the fur. Red panda is listed as endangered species.</p>
